                    CTFU: "Catch the F*ck up" Startups are about <strong>speed</strong>. If you don't have urgency, you
                    lose.

                    Successful people don't find hard things easy to do, instead they've
                    trained themselves to be better at hard things. Create habits so small
                    that they are painless.

                    Co-founders aren't people you meet at networking sessions.

                    How to recruit the best people:
                    People fear joining startups because of <strong>financial risk</strong>. Show how pay
                    might be 1% lower next year, but <strong>more in the long-term</strong>
                    "If if doesn't work out, I will find you a job at a great company."
                    Reframe the risk, remove the fear.

                    <li>Your friends.</li>

                    When you say: <strong>"We don't need your money"</strong> guess what investors want to do?
                </p>

                    <strong>Network like your startup depends on it.</strong>

                <p>
                    Because it does, your network and great cold emails are the key to hiring
                    great people and getting the best investors.

                    <strong>Focus</strong> on ONE thing in your business. And spend a year becoming
                    <strong>the best in the world at it</strong>. Focused improvement wins.

                    The <strong>best mentor</strong> is actually a peer who is building *their own startup*.
                    Learn from what they do well, steal that and discard the rest.
