# GO GO Manifest

> CTFU: "Catch the F*ck up" Startups are about *speed*. If you don't have
urgency, you lose.

> Successful people don't find hard things easy to do, instead they've
trained themselves to be better at hard things. Create habits so small
that they are painless.

> If you're excited to *use your own product* every day other people will too.

> Co-founders aren't people you meet at networking sessions. They're your
*friends*.
Get your smartest, hardest working friends and convince them to start
a company with you.

> How to recruit the best people:
People fear joining startups because of *financial risk*. Show how pay
might be 1% lower next year, but *more in the long-term*
"If if doesn't work out, I will find you a job at a great company."
Reframe the risk, remove the fear.

> Be *short and to the point* with important people.

> When you say: *"We don't need your money"* guess what investors want to do?
hint: *Give you a lot of money*

> *Don't take startup advice from*:
> 1. Your friends.
> 2. Your parents.
> 3. People who haven't built startups.

> First principle thinking is stupid. If you're a genious, it'll take you far.
For everyone else, it's f*cking useless.

> *Network like your startup depends on it.*
Because it does, your network and great cold emails are the key to hiring
great people and getting the best investors.

> 

> The *best mentor* is actually a peer who is building *their own startup*.
Learn from what they do well, steal that and discard the rest.
